    Simple class to represent each timeslot from our time horizon (e.g [0,1], [1,2]). Each
    timeslot has a start time, end time, capacity for number of jobs that can be scheduled
    within it and a list of jobs containing the scheduled jobs.

    Note: A timeslot is active (open) if it has at lest one scheduled job in it.

    Note: The purpose of this class is to only assist with implementing the greedy_algorithms algorithms
    Not the optimisation models.
