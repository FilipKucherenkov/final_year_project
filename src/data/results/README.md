# Results (Guide)
### Note: This folder contains some of the interesting results we recorded when analysing the methods. 

- `objective`: folder contains results for the objective value of the deterministic methods on the generated datasets.
- `perturbation`: folder contains results for the deviation in the objective value of the deterministic methods on the perturbed instances (GLS with Re-opt and IP model)
- `recovery`: folder contains results of the recovery model for different cost coefficients. Objective value is measured on all perturbed instances. Runtime is measured for a subset of instances.
- `runtime`: folder contains results for the runtime performance of the deterministic methods on the generated datasets.
