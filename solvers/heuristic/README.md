## Simple Greedy Heuristics which do not respect the batch capacity

Folder contains implementations for the following methods:
- `earliest_released_first.py`: A simple greedy algorithm which schedules each jobs at its release time.
- `erf_with_back_filling.py`: A simple greedy algorithm which combines Earliest-released-first strategy and back-filling.
